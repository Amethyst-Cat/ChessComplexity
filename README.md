About
====
In this project, we propose that popular chess websites like chess.com and lichess should use neural networks to develop a numerical measure of chess position complexity. We first discuss the benefits of such a measurement for chess and then show that an accurate numerical metric of complexity can be developed even with a relatively small dataset. We then discuss the technical details behind developing such a metric, and why a two-network approach may be preferable to previous one-network regressions.

Acknowledgments 
----
Special thanks to the previous work of [Goldammer](https://github.com/cgoldammer/chess-analysis/blob/master/position_sharpness.ipynb) showing that neural networks can predict position complexity to a high degree of accuracy, which inspired this project.


Accessing the Software
----
We have also created a software demonstrating one application of a complexity measure, specifically generating puzzles from any game that go beyond tactics.
